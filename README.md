# Peshawar Batch 49 Q2 - Next.js 14

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Peshawar Batch 49 Q2. This repository contains the course materials for our class on Next.js 14.

## About

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Next.js 14, a popular React framework for building web applications. The curriculum covers everything from setting up a Next.js project to deploying your application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course materials, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkdeveloper/Peshawar_Batch_49_Q2.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies. For the first two weeks (week_01 and week_02), we use npm to install the required packages. Navigate to the respective week’s directory and run the following commands:

```bash
cd Peshawar_Batch_49_Q2
cd week_01
npm install
cd ..
cd week_02 
npm install
cd ..
```
You can start the development server with:
```bash
npm run dev
```

From week_03 onwards, we will be using PNPM. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

For the rest of the classes, to install the required packages, navigate to the desired week’s directory and run the following command:
```bash
pnpm install
```
You can start the development server with PNPM using:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
