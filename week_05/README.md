# Data Fetching, Caching, and Revalidating

**Data Fetching:** This is the process of retrieving data from a source, typically a server or a database. In the context of web development, data fetching often refers to making HTTP requests to an API.

**Data Caching:** This is a technique used to store fetched data in a temporary storage area, known as a cache. The purpose of caching is to make data retrieval faster by storing data that has been fetched previously, thereby reducing the need for repeated data fetching operations.

**Data Revalidating:** This is the process of checking if the data stored in the cache is still up-to-date.

These three processes are crucial in managing data efficiently in web applications, ensuring that data is up-to-date, quickly accessible, and not unnecessarily fetched multiple times.

## Topics Covered Today

In today's session, we covered and practiced the following topics:

- ~Caching Data~
- ~Revalidating Data~
  - ~Time-based revalidation~
  - ~On-demand revalidation~
- ~Opting out of Data Caching~
- ~Individual **fetch** Requests~
- ~Multiple **fetch** Requests~
